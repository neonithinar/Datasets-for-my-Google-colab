# ML_DL_learning_materials_and_tryouts
This repo contains all my notebooks(most of them anyway) which I worked on since I started with Machine Learning and Deep Learning
most of them are tryouts from the notebooks of the Hands on ML book and Practical DL book.
This repo is part of my learning curve. as you may notice, It even contain some datasets which were intended to be used within colab back when I didn't knew 
that we could upload files into colab. IT also contains the excercise questions and answers for hands-on ML book (the theory part is given as text files. codes included in the notebooks itself)


This is a simple repo for loading csv files into google colab. I am Starting out with ML and still a lot to learn! I'm using different platforms to learn, one of which is Google colab. Recently I found that its easier to load csv to google colab when its from git. So, here I am..! I donot claim owenership to any of these datasets
